# TODO:

1. Run "npm i" to install dependencies.

2. Change / create "settings.js" file, this is where you'll put all your links
   (remember to export/import them)

3. Run "npm run start" or "npm start" to get started with development (remember development server doesnt run as smooth as the finished build)

4. Run "npm run build" to build the finished produkt.

# Routing
In this project we've used React-Router-6

# Styling

Styling is done with styled components "https://styled-components.com/" and is basicly regular css
(You can use props in styled components ex. "${props => props.color}) check the styling for "UserEndPoint" for more clarity.
